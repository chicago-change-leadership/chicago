# Chicago Change 
List of Chicago area change companies and resources
# Contributing Policy
The primary purpose of this list is a resource to the Chicago area change community. This generally means reasonable distance for someone from around here to drive to as the Chicago area is quite large with 9.5 million people!

Remote jobs and resources of course don't apply to that, meaning they don't need exposure from a Chicago-centric list and are probably found elsewhere. But what is relevant is if a particular remote job has Chicago-area employees for example, as those are then a kind of local resource for that job.

Pruning defunct organizations or dead links is a helpful contribution. This list serves to help find resources, and it can't do that effectively if it's wasting people's time pointing them in the wrong direction.

Still not sure? Just submit a pull request! The fact you're considering means there's a good chance your change belongs on here.

And thank you for your help!
